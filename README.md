CS628 HOS Assignments

## HOS01
I tried multiple times to get the assignment to work using GitHub CodeSpaces, but after many hours I took a break. I had the idea to try it on my linux laptop, running locally. When I did that, I was able to complete the assignment within 45 minutes (including typing time). This is why the screenshots have different colored browsers. I use MS Edge for all CityU stuff, but it's blue on my main machine and yellow on my linux laptop.
